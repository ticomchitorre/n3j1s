Yohani has collaborated with various artists, including mxmtoon, Chelsea Cutler, and Claud. These collaborations have further showcased her versatility and willingness to explore different musical styles. Her latest project, "Ashes," is a testament to her artistic growth, showcasing a more mature and introspective side of her songwriting. Yohani has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
